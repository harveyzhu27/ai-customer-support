        "The concern about a high APR (Annual Percentage Rate) on your Aven account can be influenced by several factors. Here's an explanation based on the documents I reviewed:\n\n1. **Variable Rate**: Aven Cards have a variable rate that fluctuates based on an index (either the Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This means that your APR can shift up or down depending on changes in these indices [1].\n\n2. **Rate Caps**: While Aven cannot directly adjust the offer once given",
        "there is a cap on the rates. For Aven Cards",
        "the maximum APR is capped at 18% [2].\n\n3. **Offer and Terms**: Aven determines credit line size and interest based on an applicant's income",
        "credit",
        "equity",
        "and debt obligations through a fully automated underwriting system. Unfortunately",
        "this means that individual offers are determined algorithmically and cannot be adjusted by Aven after they are set [3].\n\n4. **Fixed Rate Options**: For some cardholders",
        "Aven offers the opportunity to set up fixed payment and fixed rate Simple Loan plans [4].\n\nYou may want to review your specific account terms and check if you have the option to switch to a fixed rate plan if eligible",
